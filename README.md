Challenges faced:

As i havent use TypeScript earlier i was getting errors while i try to code so couldn't impliment using typeScript
as i have put in more time to learn new concept typeScript implementation has some bugs


Conclusion :

I will put in more efforts to master the tech stacks that is require to be more confident in implementation
